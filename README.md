# ChinaPost Coder
This program matches Chinese addresses to their respective postal codes using a China Post's website. The script creates two columns, one with just the first result and one with all of the results generated by the search. Once downloaded, you will likely need to review the results to ensure that you are using the best postal code. You should do research on the Chinese Postal Code system before using this program.
